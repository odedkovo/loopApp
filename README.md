# Wellcome to loopApp - home assignment by moveo.

This project has built by me as a part off home assignment by moveo.

## The project:

In this project there are two pages.
The main page is the homepage and about page.
The about page exlpain about me and about the app and in the homepage you can see the assignment.
in the homepage there are 8 rows that represent 0 audio loops.
Each of the channels shows the channel's name, has a mute button, a range that shows the progress of the track, and has a unique color.

On the bottom of the page there is a section with control buttons.
Each button effects in a different way on the track:
Play : when pressed all channels start playing simultaneously.
Stop: when pressed all playing channels stop and go back to start.
isLoop: when active, each time the isLoop ends
all channels immediately go back to start and play again .
Pause: when pressed all playing channels stop and and stays at their position.

On the top of the page there is a section with range control.
On that place you can see the progress bar that shows the progress of the song . and you can

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
